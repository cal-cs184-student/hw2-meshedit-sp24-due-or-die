<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
  The de Casteljau algorithm recursively uses linear interpolation to approximate points on a Bézier curve. Each iteration uses the initial control points and a parameter t to determine a point on the curve, and ultimately, points corresponding to different t values are connected to form the Bézier curve. I obtain the next set of control points by iterating through the control points using a for loop.
</p>

<b>
  Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
  The de Casteljau algorithm extended to Bézier surfaces simply uses two parameters, u and v. First, interpolate each row of control points using u to generate a series of final control points. Then, interpolate this set of control points using the v parameter to obtain the point on the Bézier surface corresponding to the pair of u and v. I implement the Bézier surface by calling evaluate1D with parameter u for each row of control points, and then calling evaluate1D with parameter v on the resulting n control points.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
  My implementation code refers to the printNeighborPositions function. During the iteration over each triangle, it accesses its face and calls the face()->normal() method to obtain the normalized normal vector, which is then accumulated (specifically, if it is a half-edge on the boundary, the step of taking its face is skipped). Finally, the resulting vector is normalized using the unit() method to obtain the area-weighted vertex normal.

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  For the edge flip operation, I drew two triangles, selected the e0 edge, and labeled all the elements involved in the flip operation. Then, I assigned values to these elements. Next, based on the diagram after the flip, I adjusted the pointers of the elements. Once all the element pointers are properly adjusted, the flip operation is effectively completed.

<p>
  Similar to the edge flip operation, for the edge split operation, I drew two triangles, selected the e0 edge, and labeled all the elements involved in the split operation.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  I basically followed the specs and comments to implement the loop subdivision. First, I calculated the newPosition for all the points, and then iterated through the edges to perform split operations. Next, for edges where isNew is true, if they connect a new point with an old one, I performed a flip operation on them. During the debugging process, my graphics were very strange. After several hours of debugging, I realized that vertices with a degree of 3 were dipping in, while others were protruding. So, I considered that there might be an error when calculating the coefficient u. Indeed, when the degree wasn't 3, my floating-point division was written as integer division, causing u, which should have been a fraction, to turn into 0.

<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
  After the Loop subdivision, the mesh becomes denser and appears smoother. At the sharp corners of the cube, it is evident that the corners have also become smooth. I believe that this cannot be avoided through pre-splitting because the smoothing of the sharp edges is likely influenced by the positional weights during the position update. I tried to make the cube more cubic, but the sharp edges are certainly going to be "pulled down" by the surrounding points.

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
  This can be achieved by pre-splitting the diagonals on each face once. The underlying principle of this method is to ensure that each vertex of the cube has a degree of 6, thereby avoiding the asymmetry caused by different degrees during the position update.
